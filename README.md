# Ben Eater 8-bit Computer Emulator
Attempt to create a Ben Eater 8 bit computer emulator

## Background
I'm fascinated about technology, so getting to know how computers work (and maybe build one) is something that I really enjoy doing.
I came across Ben Eater's 8-bit computer series a while ago and thought about building an emulator, since I don't have all the parts to build it at the moment.

If you want to have a look at his awesome content, check out his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater

## TODO
- [ ] Update implementation since the last video I watched was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCscQGBIL-Y
- [ ] Build a Blazor WASM project to load programs and see the emulator in action
