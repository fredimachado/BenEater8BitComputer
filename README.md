Attempt to create a Ben Eater 8-bit computer emulator

## Background

I'm fascinated about technology, so getting to know how computers work (and maybe build one) is something that I really enjoy doing.
I came across Ben Eater's 8-bit computer series a while ago and thought about building an emulator, since I don't have all the parts to build it at the moment.

## Instructions

Instructions implemented so far: **NOP**, **LDA**, **ADD**, **SUB**, **STA**, **LDI**, **JMP**, **OUT**, **HLT**

## TODO

- [x] Create compiler
- [ ] Update implementation since the last video I watched was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCscQGBIL-Y
- [ ] Create a Blazor WASM Web project
- [ ] Create compiler page in Web project
- [ ] Create a page to load programs and see the emulator in action
